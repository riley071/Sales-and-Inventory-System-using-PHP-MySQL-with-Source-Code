The Sales and Inventory System is a simple project that will help wholesale businesses manage the products that they are selling and monitor their available stock. 
The Wholesale Sales and Inventory System is a straightforward project designed to assist wholesale businesses in managing their products and keeping track of available stocks.
It helps to identify and manage products nearing their expiration date, notifying users when stocks are close to expiring. 
Users can then update the system to reflect the deduction of expired products from inventory, ensuring accurate monitoring and availability for sales.
The system organizes products by type and category, allowing easy searching and retrieval of specific items. For instance, if a customer is looking for a particular type of product that is temporarily out of stock, the system enables the user to search for similar items within the same category, providing alternative options to the customer.

#The process flow of the Wholesale Sales and Inventory System is as follows:

1. The system administrator inputs all types of products and categorizes them accordingly. This data is necessary for creating new products and organizing them within the system.

2. The system administrator also adds the list of products available for sale by the wholesale company.

3. Additionally, the system administrator records the suppliers associated with the company, aiding in tracking stock origins upon receipt.

4. Before initiating any sales transactions, the receiving process must be completed to update the system's inventory. The system administrator populates this list to reflect the availability of products in the system.

5. The system administrator maintains a list of customers for sales transactions, facilitating tracking of purchases made by clients. Alternatively, transactions can be conducted without customer details, allowing for guest sales.

6. Once the aforementioned lists are populated, the system administrator or authorized personnel can begin utilizing the sales feature of the system.
